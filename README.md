## A close-as-possible server emulation project for the 3DS and WiiU

## For detailed information, see the [wiki](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Pretendo/wiki)

# Service repositories:
- account server [https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/account](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/account)
- Friends service (WIP) [https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Friends](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Friends)
- Super Mario Maker (WIP) [https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/SuperMarioMaker](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/SuperMarioMaker)
- eShop (PoC) [https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/eShop](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/eShop)

# Non-service repositories:
- Official Discord bot [https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Yamamura](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Yamamura)
- Official proxy [https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/maryo](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/maryo)

# What is this useful for?
1. Preservation - The WiiU and the 3DS, just like every other console, have an EOL (End of Life.) There will be a point where Nintendo shuts the entirety of Nintendo Network that the WiiU and 3DS depend on for many features. One of the goals with this project is to keep Nintendo Network (NN) alive as Pretendo Network (PN), and to prepare for the EOL.
2. Customization - With a custom server you have full control. Nintendo currently enforces certain things which may not be desirable to all (for example, requiring console-specific information to login and use services, as official accounts are tied to consoles). This could also become useful for tools like Cemu and Citra, as the Cemu currently supports online play but requires dumps of console-specific files to get online (as, again, official accounts are tied to consoles) and Citra has yet to officially add NN support. Custom servers could remove these barriers and allow anyone to go online with Cemu and Citra.

# Cool! How far along is it?
Not far at all. Currently only NNID (PNID (Pretendo Network ID)) accounts work, and no games are currently supported

# Supported games:
- None yet
